### Rock Paper Scissors

A rock paper scissors game that you can play by using buttons.

Everytime you press a button, a message will pop up that says who has won the round and another message will show you the current scoreboard. The player plays against the computer, which randomly selects rock, paper or scissors.

Skills that I have shown:
- Using Javascript functions
- Using eventlisteners on the buttons
- Using if, else statements
- Using Javascript to implement text into the DOM-tree
